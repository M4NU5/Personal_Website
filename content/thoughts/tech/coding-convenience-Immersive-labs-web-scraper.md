You ever look at your achivements page on XY or Z website and think "I would love to show this whole page and not just piece meal my linkedin account resulting in just unproffessional noise on my public profile"... No? Well thats what i was thinking. So to solve this I built a webscrapping bot that extracts all the essential details. Heres how i did it.


Ingest Webpage -> Scrape out each badge -> Fetch shareable badge page for each achievement [Title, Share_url, image_url] -> Generate markdown file -> copy into hugo project
