# Want to add google-services.json into your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline?


Are you working on a project that requires you to consume or interact with google services?
Perhaps a custom script to interact with sheets or you need analytics data for your website. This is pretty easy to run locally with a **google_credentials.json** file slapped into your projects directory. 
But what if you wanted to run this script in a GitHub Action... In a CI/CD pipeline?
