# The dawn of the Agile age

We live in an age of agile and scrum in the tech world. Some argue it was incepted by the agile manifesto KT <- insert link-- where agile techniques used by startups were codified into how software should be built. 

In the age of waterfall methods where companies would key years to go to market with some fully fledged program and backed by all the monies in the world.  
This was turned on its head by reducing the time between the inception of the idea to the idea being in peoples hands. Only focusing on core critical functionality and seeing whether the market even fucking wants what youre offering. 
Less capital is required for this apprach, so it makes sense for startups to take this route. Its still to this day used as a guiding light for any aspiring startup founder to be AGILE! 

I mean who wouldnt want to be agile, it got us google, uber, amazon, and a whole host of other unicorn companies.


But as any good scrum or agile trained professional will tell you. Agile is just a concept ITS A CULTURE! Youre entire organisation needs to embody this agile methodology, reacting quickly to consumer feedback. 

# The shift to agile

When the large tech companies of today started to blow up everyone and their dog wanted what they had. Wanted their way of working. It was a workplace revolution! Out with dedecated desks and cubicale. In with the new trendy hot desking alowing for people to agilly move around the workplace free to unleash thier creative spirit... right?!

This agile manifesto thing was being talked about alot so we need to also adopt that into our mid to large organisation so we can remain compeditatve in the emerging techological environment we now find ourselves in. 

OUT WITH WATERFALL. thats for losers and old people. The trendy new thing is agile, the hip google looking motherfucker on the block.

#### The sprint
Great. we are now going to break down bodies of work into finite deliverable chunks. that can be delivered in a sprint which is about 2 weeks of work. GREAT. Lets also have a daily standup where we communicate to the team any issues we might be having. This is great, we as software engineers are trying to think creativly and can sometimes get stuck. Bouncing ideas off people can help us solve the issue quicker also known as rubber ducking 

Everyone gives their updates in the morning then goes on doing what they say they were going to do. COMMUNICATION IS GOOD

### The planned incromment
but a single sprint wont embody more larger inititives... After all we are a mid to large company. So lets cluster a couple of sprints together and call it a planned increment. this gets the more executive level involved so they can effectivly direct the work efforts the teams under them. Lets make this incromment 3 months long and x number of sprints fall into this. GREAT. 

Dedicate to delivering on whatever larger inititive or epic by the end of the planned increment that spans about 4 months. 

## The Glorious story point
Obviously we need to communicate to the wider organisetion about the complexity of our work. So at the inseption of our planned Incromment lets use the ever omnipitent of an engineers mind to guess how complex the task they are performing is and how long it will take for them to complete. 
This with each PI itteraction should be tuned more and more to the 'true capacity' of your team. 




## What reality looks like

You might be thinking well ofcourse william this agile framework is great and there is a reason why its used by everyone. But i will ask you, what does this result in? 

Before i jump down this autistic consultant minute counting i would like to highlight that according to the deep work bros of the internet 2-3 hours of dedicated uninteruped deep work is what you want to aim for. As a programmer myself I like to get into the groove and knock out 4 hours like a degenerate. So with that all prefficed i give you a typical day in the world of corperate scrum.

A standup every day of 15 min but lets be honest it regularly runs over to 30 min +
This include a hour long ticket 'grooming' session in the beginning of the week. then you have that one poor fucker on your team called the scrum master whos job it is to go to the weekly sync meeting with the maniacs running this  clownshow at the Pi level.

I already hear you saying but william that isnt so bad. Its just 30 min a day plus some extra hours here and there. to you i say NO its more then just 30 min. Every meeting has a preperation time whether its a couple mins lets say 5-10 min. We are at 40 min. Ok Cool so you wake up start work with a 9am standup right? 
well no as a multi national team spanning the globe or just working on a team where your team lead isnt a phycopath its probably at 9:30 or 10...Great that leaves a 1 hour seggment best case before and you ran a little over to 10:30 that leaves you 1:30 till lunch... And fuck you need to grab a coffee well that coffee. The Sole reason fo your existance in the morning has just fucked any chance of getting anythig of substance done. 
Great lunch time 12-1. You get back to your desk having eatend a metric fuck ton of rice from that Thai place down the road and you hit that 'mid day' slump. Now this can be avoided. Im just giving a generic day. So lets say we have a healthy 1:30 - 5 to knock that baby out the park. after you have reqauired your 4th coffee for the day. you have 3.5 hours at your disposal... Oh wait i forgot that we are working in a large corperate you know what that means... MEETINGS!!!! Rememeber that 1 hour Scrum sync weekly where you wait in line listening to everyone huffing thier own farts about achiveing the very thing they said they would. before you get a turn it have a big wiff of your own home brewed bullshit that you listrally put together not 3 days before because everyone has the memory of a goldfish with alsimers. Only then to remind alice who for 3 weeks still hasnt made that admin accounts for you and your team. You might say but william that is why you have those meetings. and to you i say no fuck you, If it takes you 3 weeks to make an admin account in your org you are not agile.
And you will get to the end of the meeting and have the scrum king himself say "remember everyone over communication is good" NO IT NOT ITS CALLED OVER COMMUNCATION FOR A REASON, TO MUCH. 

or how about discussing a new idea with the team. Or running some training workshop. Or god forbid your CTO pulls you into a vendor review session for the 10th time because our budget constrained team definitly needs to consider adding another steaming pile of bullshit sold to him over a dinner that was probably more expensive then your months salary.
Or what ever 30 min tidbit bullshit meeting know you have because CORPERATE!!

This results you getting to the end of your day as a programmer thinking WTF have i actually done today. 

And maybe by the end of the sprint you were able to squeeze out that deliverable inbetween taking a huff of the fart sack that could have taken 2 days of focused work. 





Abviously we need a way to quantify wether teams are over commiting or undercommitting thier capacity. So we can assign 'Story points' to everything. How are theres story 

But! We need to codify this, we need to build out the processes people within the organiseaiton follow


Great. now lets put this lovely plan into action into a company that has


<-- Insert a image of the whole scrum process here --


It becomes a oraborious where the ratio of talking about doing things and reporting it to actully doing it is 5 : 1


## Think logically


I will bet you honour of scrum master that if you went to any other industory be that Lawyers, doctors, HR, Sales, marketing, finance. And asked them if the entire team gets together every day in the morning to discuss the things they are going to do for that day. they will say get fucked your crazy no one has time for that shit. We just trust that people will do thier jobs and we meet when we need to meet. 
So why then in tech do we do it. Why dont we trust our engineers to go ahead tackle a problem and comeback when the task is done and report on it. 

Is it because Techies are so socially awkward we would rather commit sepaku over listening to Sasha from HRs stroy about what she did last weekend for an whole hour. 

Generally in tech we have the idea of being locked in, when we are trying to solve a problem. You even see it in series where the characters will say 'Dont disturb terry mans locked in and working, We can tell him about whatever it is later'. 
But when you work in an office people dont give a fuck and will happly pull you out of your autistic mind palace that you finaly found the keys too just to tell you about the new mod they are adding to thier car this weekend. 


Its a programmers job to develop code. Let them develop the fucking code. Get out of their way. 
Coding time should be considered holy grail time. but because no one knows what it takes to write code, lets micro manage them into ineffectiveness. which results in you hiring more people to help with volocity. and somehow you find yourself a a point where you have a 20 person team reporting to one person and your standups are no longer just those 15 min but 40 min DAILY!

remember that knock on effect i metioned earlier. 



## Conclusion
In conclusion as we are getting to the end of my rant
We are getting to the end of this article and you might be asking. So what do we do about this. Its a great question. How do we tell the c suite to just point in a direction and let the manic programmers plow forward like demented wolves after a kill. Less micro management of every task that is being done. No i dont think you should have daily standups to tell people that you are still working on that problem because youre a dumb fuck that cant get two rocks to bash together. 

Team syncs are important yes but should be used sparingly. As Defend the time your developer team has. Block out hours for them, if need be. Give them a place of rispite to flee from the idiacy of day to day dredge and grind... and maybe just maybe you might get a team that will be both incredably effective and abosolutly love you for letting them do what they love
