## AI is holding you back
We are a solid couple years into the AI revolution. CEOs decreed an end of all developers was Ni. and yet i see  no end.

Who needs a programmer made of wetware when you have one made of cold hard calculating silicon.

Im going to posit an idea here... If the programmer ending AI existed why would the company creating it make it access able to the public. 
Hear me out. If i have a miricle AI that could program me anything I would ever dreamed. I would ask it to make competitors to an existing application but better. You could then itterate so fast that you would leave everyone in the dust. Which makes me pause when looking at any existing AI models being sold....

This is not to say I havent used AI. My company was a very early adopter of github copilot, I was luck enough to get my hands on one of the keys and instantly went to work with my AI powered IDE.
It was great, it was like the AI was reading my mind. Writing out good boilerplate and even some other more 'advanced' pieces of logic. WOW. 

But after using it for a couple months i noticed i started relying on it more and more. The time it would take for me to write out some boilerplate manually skyrocketed. As programmers we all know this, when you stop coding your forget how to code. 

So as a step to resharpen my blade I disabled copilot and went back to normal intelisense. Something very shocking revieled itself... a new programming habit.in my programming habits

Reviewing and validating code is very different to writing code

The more you use a tool the more you rely on it

GOALS of this article:
Dont rely on AI
Build your personal skills
AI though helpful can easily be a crutch
