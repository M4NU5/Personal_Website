My uncle forgot his keys…Ok when you have just left home. Not so ok when you at 5 hours from it!

He was traveling with his family to the Kruger National Park. His trip takes him passed Johannesburg where I live so they all stayed the night, catching up with family, leaving the last 4 hours of the trip for the next day. When they arrived he realised that he had forgotten the key to the roof mounted carrier probably 5 hours away at their home. Thing is all their overnight gear was stored in the roof top carrier. Toothbrushes, Underwear, Cables you know all overnight essentials!!!  
I have never picked this type of lock before… Well no time like the present. I grab my picking set and get to work. The first attempt was partly successful but not completely unlocked successful… RESEARCH TIME!

From online pictures I assume the lock has a wafer mechanism. Looking closer there is a code on the lock barrel: N048. MORE RESEARCH TIME!

A few searches later I find the N048 code is used but [Thule Sweden](https://www.thule.com/en-us/) COOL. Going to their website and typing in the product code: N048 gives me a Lock barrel. Great! Now what… That information is nice but it doesn’t help me… Or does it O.O

I do some digging on the Youtubes and come across how to replace Thule lock barrels. Insert key, turn to 2 o’clock, insert a blank key and pull the lock barrel out then do the reverse when putting in your new one… JACKPOT!!!

I go back to the carrier, good thing it has a lock on either side… I pick the other lock to 2 o’clock, ram in a ‘Blank rod’ (I inverted one of my rake picks) and PRESTO I wiggle the lock barrel free. We’re in the end game now!!!

Having a look inside, there is an interesting looking notch at the end of where the lock barrel resides. What if I use a screw driver to replace the locks function? One large screwdriver and some tape later I insert the screwdriver and give it a turn. The notch turns without any resistance ending with a soft click and I start grinning like an idiot pushing open the roof carrier to reveal the locked away treasure of toothbrushes and underpants!!!
