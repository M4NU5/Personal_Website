You may have heared by now that tenable has bought vulcan for a pretty penny


tenable as a company provides a cloud posture management capability and vulcan boasts to provide a single unified view for all vulnerabilities accross your organisaiton.

Love the sales pitch and they sound like a match made in heaven... but ill address the elephent in the room... Why the fuck would you want to spend XXX amount on the steaming pile of shit that is vulcan. maybe it is just me but all my experiances with the tool has been commically bad where it would probbaly be easier to agregate your vulnerability data in a excel document then use thier excel document with a UI. 

There are a couple of core features of a vulnerability management platform that are nessassary to function. those features being deduplication of vulnerability data. Enrichment of said vulnerability data and aggregation for both reporting and exploration of your threat information.

In my experiance Vulcan fails almost all of these maybe except for the aggregation part which would mean it is a glorified excel file that allows you to show pretty pictures to your excecutives hopefully lulling them in to a false sense of security with pretty colours and make them feel like everything is in hand. While behind the scenes everything is in flames becuase the poor engineers cant make heads or tails of the steaming dumpster fire of shit that vulcan vomets onto their jira board.

But let me not get to ahead of myself, lets look at deduplication.
