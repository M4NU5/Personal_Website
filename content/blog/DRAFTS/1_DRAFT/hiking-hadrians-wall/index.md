All right you guys know me I like a challange and wont pass up a good opportunity

So I've just completed my Adrian's wall hike. Completed it in 4 days and if you know me you know I like a challenge. Big sigh. I don't expect to take this as a challenge. This was actually intended to be a post work hike that allows me to decompress from my previous job and preparation for my next job details coming shortly

But Knowing your boy Big Psy what it was intended to be a casual walk turned into

This a challenge yourself moment on my first day I was hiked for XXX kilometers and just before pitching my tent I came across some guys who were doing what I thought was madness. They were looking to hike the hadron's wall in one go in without stopping now. Mind you, this was 9:00 at night and they had a good portion of the whole thing to do still but they were doing it as a challenge to do the whole wall without stopping

Now because they would have been going through the whole night and we've definitely gone in chili. But anyway it's not like they had anything on them. All they had was a basic backpack. Simple backpack with basic supplies like water and I don't know what it is but a triggered something in me. Something that I never liked to turn down a good challenge and see how well I can excel at something. So the next day I got up packed up my bags and went ham seeing how far I could get

Find I just like hiking and my hiking legs would just have to materialize somehow, but I proceeded to hike 28 km that day on the second day. Could have already done more but given the hilliness of the ear, middle portion of Hadrian's wall and my thick skull tackling every Hill like it was like my life depended on it. I evidently burnt out but luckily as the sun was setting I came to a campsite known as wall sand extras actress. XXX and decided to camp there for the night. My body spent and was only just enough energy to get to the pub 5 minutes down the road and have a burger

Count I started a little bit later than I should have. Admittedly, maybe it was the burger from the night before or the jolly pub patrons the guitar and we're singing joyfully for someone's birthday

But with day three underway I arrived at sycamore Gap to see the butchering that took place 2 years prior and proceeded to dig deep and push on

Half I somehow ran into a friend who was running Adrian's wall. Him and his mates were doing it in 3 days and we're packed a lot lighter than I, which is a smart thing to do retrospectively I packed way too much stuff that too ignited again. That weird drive to push hard and push as far as you can push until the point where your body fails. Find that limit. See if you can go past it

I promise I'm not psychopathic

But my goal of me reaching the Robin Hood inn was indeed ambitious. Maybe a little bit too ambitious cuz I find myself only arriving at the end an hour and a half after the sunset to find Sid and closed. There's no lights on. It was very sad but I found the campsite pitched my tent and promptly passed out having walked 30 km that day

Thank God I had a so it makes things a little bit more complicated while camping is definitely possible and if you want to do it with a hammock ingCampCamping

If you are to do it with a hammock however, it makes it a lot more complicated and you may need to deviate from the trail. I wild camped one of my three nights. As for time am

As for the time that I would that you should allocate to do this, I would say minimum of 4 days. If you're hiking, you can do it in three if you really push and you pack lighter than you pack light, but you would need to get up as the sun rises and you go until the sun sets. As soon as you're burning an hour of suntime, you're losing about 4 to 6 km each hour and that can eat into your distance traveled. So four days would be my recommendation as a minimum. As for your average person, I'd probably go closer to six if you want to have a leisurely stroll and not be walking all day, so you can get up slightly later walk during the day be finished by 4:00. Have a good pintender now! While

The Robin hood inn was great, Had breakfast and promptly headed off for my last day

A sunny day, 12 km and way to much asphalt later i stopped at a pub and called it quits

Treating myself to a solid spa session at the end of the walk
