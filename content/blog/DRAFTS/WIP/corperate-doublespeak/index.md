We all know it. 
Where marketing is saying one thing where the reality is quite the opposite. 

Goege orwells 1982 coined the terms double speak and double think 

The terms are defined in the book as X and Y

Now im a nieve little boy believing everyone engages in good failth and believes in product exalance... 


If you take these definitions and apply it everywhere you can start to see where this fictional idea is infact a very real phinominon in our modern day and we havent even gottent to the distopian part yet!

YOu can only realy know if this is occuring if you have knowelage of a situation.
Seeing how people are talking about things but then how things are actully on the ground

These concepts come into effect where both are held in ones mind as true 
Both conflicting ideas are true.
I dont know if... Whether is is though self indoctrination or the strength of fumes from all the bullshit being passed around causing the collective delusion.

It makes me uncomfortable seeing people easily and without blinking say something that sounds on its face to be really true but in reality the opposite is the case.

examples

I had the honour of working for a company that was lost in this malais of double think.
The team i worked with were trail blazers punching almost laughably above our weight in comparision  to others.
Maybe the fumes are getting to me but i truely belive we were all superstars. 
Step outside of our utopia though would hit me with a harsh reality
All marketing and messaging being blasted into peoples brains was one thing were you can clearly see the C-Suite moving the opposite way. 
Messaging about a long term commitment to exelance but behind close doors make decissions that only affect what really matters a couple of metrics and appeasing our private equity investors.

Now i understand that the shareholders are king and we as good workers do everything in our power to make them achive those above market rate returns but there comes a people where you stop and think O that is all that maters to them. 
Not the 'quality of the product'
Not the 'Long term picuture' 
All that matters is the cashout. and if that cashout sets a ticking timebomb to go off the view is 'If we are out its not our problem'


I feel the true nature is shown when the chips are down. Your company has narrowly survived a P1 incident by the luck of a single alert and rapid response from subject matter juggernouts walking the company halls.

Now these incidents can cause a reality check for alot of companies. But there are 2 ways to react. More investment or BAU

In your post motrum your c-suite comes in patting all involved engineers on the back saying what a great job they have done saving the company but then go on to spend 45 minuites remining everyone that no additional funding will be provided... You realise you are on that BAU organisation that doesnt actully care. It just wants to survive long enough to get those at the top their payday.

In true startup style. Got my cashout? Not my problem
