## Introduction

Knowlage capture is a tough thing. In this age where we have a firehgose of data and infomration being thrown at us all the time how we capture and process this information becomes increasingly important. 470

Enter notion, the saviour of project management and colaberation where you can manage your life in a single app. 
Notion was the new kid on the block when the likes of evernote were the real heavy hitters. 
And for the most part coming from a evernote landscape notion does a pretty good job.
You build you structure and fill out content as you need. Morfing the structure as and when you need while using relational databases to link everything up.

Yeah i can see all you project managers cumming in your pants right now.

Exposed its API (FACT CHECK!!) allowing for custom methods to integrate with it.
This lead to a whole host of cool little projects that would enable you in inject data into your notion world. Whether it is a app that you add to your browser or savetonotion bot on twitter/x people started using it all.

This is particularity prevelent in the bug bounty space where you see people comenting on posts savetonotion like a self report. Getting whatever it is to be added to their inbox for later consumption.

This lead to people building

But what if you are out and about and one to snap or capture something quickly.

Why keep is better then notion for quick note **capture**






Notion for how awesome it is 
and how all the grindset bros decree it as the second comming of allah is wierdly limited for one reason of quick note capture 

IT LOSES THEM!


What do yoiu mean i hear you ask 
You can just share an article to notion and it will post it to your inbox for later consumption 
You can ever setup a bot to capture a twitter post and add it to your inbox.
This all works fine but it fails where in one key area. The quick capture widget on your phone. and the whole phone experiance tbh

<TK Insert image of phone widget/>

If god forbit you click away or get distracted at the moment in time you are capturing a quick note because notion will  lose it if you didnt click save.

BUT IT GETS WORSE!!!!

If you have a dodgy internet connection when you hit save?! Kiss that quick note good by because a 'network connection error' will nuke what you just wrote and notion will go the extra mile and shit the bed to





There are also wierd limitations. Like i cant record a voice note for myself???
Or i cant attach an image to the note?
 Or I cant have a note that persists past a screen lock?? 
Or you hit the lock button by mistake and forgot to click save Notion will drop all those packets


and as a final note im sorry but the notion app is fucking shit on mobile. It takes forever to load anything and if you are wanting to quickly looking up something you will be sitting there for 10 minutes just waiting for your interlinked databases and pages to load 
Why the fuck is there no local caching. Even at a basic level?>!



## Keep

Step in keep whos widget looks like this

<TK Insert image/>


Its got it all, Its got the standard note its got quick camera its even got a drawing pad!
When you create the note the note doesnt disappear and automatically saves
It is native to android 





I use obsidian for my seond brain
Having notion and obsidian open when im cleaning and processing the inbox from notion and pulling it over to obsidian feels tedious. Who wants to start up 2 apps to do something. It raises blockers to me managing my mind palace a who would want that


Obsidian has a whole host of community plugins which is out of scope for this article but one of them TK XXX allows you to mount whatever you want as a panel.

i AHEV CGONE AHEAD and integrated keep into my obsidian to have a single panel for my knowlage management. Now who wouldnt want that?! 



Knowlage capture and refinement needs to be as simple and integrated into your ongoing processes as possible. With 





## Conclusion

Dont get me wrong, notion as a tool can be great. I use it to track work and projects. and in this regard it excels at...
When your on your computer and have a strong internet connection.
You make kanban boards 
You can enrich pages with pages

But when it comes to a second brain approach
where you want more imergant knowledge and ideas that are captured notion feels to ridged for me at least... Which projects require mind you 

Keep can be
